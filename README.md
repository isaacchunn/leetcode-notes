# leetcode-notes
This repository does not contain any code related to any of the problems i've done as it would take up a lot of time and space to sort them. The aim of this repository is to store the solutions I've done along the way and to track the progress as I progressively attempt harder questions that involves Graphs, Dynamic Programming and Tries. I mostly do my coding exercises in C++ even though I should be using Python, but I love the speed I get from C++ even if the syntax is more confusing and long to type.

> [!NOTE] 
>  Solving tons of problems is just for my enjoyment and does not relate to myself being good at everything. I just like to tinker with problems that come across as difficult to gather experiences on how to solve something and propagate this knowledge to other domains.
